        "# Research Assistant AI Agent Report\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "This project implements a Research Assistant AI Agent using LangGraph to process PDF documents, answer user queries, and leverage both short-term and long-term memory. The agent extracts text from PDFs, stores insights in ChromaDB, and uses a Grok LLM to provide intelligent responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agent Architecture\n",
        "The agent is built using LangGraph with the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LLM**: Grok (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) from xAI, used for answering queries and summarizing PDFs.\n",
        "- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2 for text extraction and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for chunking.\n",
        "- **Memory**:\n",
        "  - **Short-term**: LangGraph's MemorySaver retains conversation state within a session using thread_id.\n",
        "  - **Long-term**: ChromaDB stores conversation messages, PDF chunks, and summaries for retrieval across sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Graph\n",
        "A single node (`query_handling_llm`) processes queries, integrates PDF content, and retrieves context from ChromaDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Memory Design\n",
        "\n",
        "### Short-term Memory\n",
        "- Implemented using MemorySaver, which stores the State object (messages, conversation_id, pdf_content, pdf_chunks) in-memory for a session.\n",
        "- The State object accumulates messages during a session, allowing the agent to reference previous queries and responses within the same thread_id.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: When a user asks about a PDF and follows up with a specific question, the messages list retains the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Long-term Memory\n",
        "- ChromaDB stores conversation messages, PDF chunks, and summaries with embeddings.\n",
        "- The `store_in_chroma` function saves data with a conversation_id, and `retrieve_context` queries relevant information based on the latest user query.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: The agent can recall a PDF's summary or previous queries in a new session using the same conversation_id.\n",
        "\n",
        "## PDF Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Extraction**: PyPDF2 extracts text from PDFs.\n",
        "- **Chunking**: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splits text into 500-character chunks with 50-character overlap for efficient embedding.\n",
        "- **Summarization**: The LLM generates a 100-150 word summary of the PDF, stored in ChromaDB for long-term recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Queries and Responses\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a real PDF on \"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Detection\" (uploaded as `Pcos (IEEE).pdf`):\n",
        "\n",
        "### Query: \"I uploaded a research paper. Tell me about its content.\"\n",
        "- **Response**: The paper discusses the detection and diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning techniques, adhering to IEEE standards. It covers data collection from medical datasets, feature engineering, model training with algorithms like SVM and neural networks, and evaluation metrics for accuracy in clinical applications.\n",
        "- **Explanation**: The agent uses the `pdf_content` from the State and summarizes it using the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Query: \"What is the main topic of the paper?\"\n",
        "- **Response**: The main topic is the application of machine learning for early detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women, with a focus on IEEE-compliant methodologies.\n",
        "- **Explanation**: The agent leverages short-term memory (previous messages) and PDF content to provide a specific answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Query: \"Remind me about the paper I asked about earlier.\"\n",
        "- **Response**: Earlier, you inquired about a research paper on PCOS detection using machine learning. The content highlighted diagnostic models, feature selection, and performance evaluation based on IEEE guidelines.\n",
        "- **Explanation**: The agent retrieves the summary and conversation history from ChromaDB using the `conversation_id`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Bonus Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Summarization**: Implemented in the `summarize_pdf` function, which generates a concise summary stored in ChromaDB.\n",
        "- **Multi-document Support**: The agent can process multiple PDFs by storing chunks with unique conversation_ids, though cross-referencing is not fully implemented.\n",
        "- **Memory Visualization**: Not implemented due to complexity, but memory usage can be inferred from ChromaDB query results logged during testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Test Scenarios:\n",
        "- Uploaded `Pcos (IEEE).pdf` and queried its content.\n",
        "- Asked follow-up questions to test short-term memory (e.g., main topic).\n",
        "- Queried without PDF content to test long-term memory retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results:\n",
        "The agent accurately extracts text from the PDF, answers queries using the content, retains session context via MemorySaver, and recalls past information via ChromaDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "The Research Assistant AI Agent effectively combines LangGraph, ChromaDB, and Grok (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) to process PDFs and answer queries with memory. Short-term memory ensures session coherence, while long-term memory enables cross-session knowledge retention. Future improvements could include multi-document cross-referencing, enhanced PDF parsing for complex layouts, and memory usage visualization.\n"
